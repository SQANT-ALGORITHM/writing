I am a lawyer.  I write software.  I am an "impending death of the legal profession" nonbeliever.  New technology---"expert systems", "AI", "machine learning", "deep neural networks"---will not eat lawyerdom as we know it.

If you asked me to spec out what any such system would have to do to replace, rather than augment, the core value proposition of a single respected colleague, I couldn't deliver.  Nor is there a training set on hand.  Feed your net [Christensen](https://lccn.loc.gov/96010894) and [Susskind](https://lccn.loc.gov/96017176) and you will get ... more [Christensen](https://lccn.loc.gov/2011008440) and [Susskind](https://lccn.loc.gov/2012540370), or an uncanny simulacrum.  As for what large networked systems can and will be trained to do: I look forward to delegating my drudgework.

Cynicism about the legal profession's efficacy, on the other hand, is mandatory.  The facts compel it.  And a great deal of pain.

Fortunately, all the fundamental technology required for an efficient, accessible, ethically laudable American legal profession---in law and in software---has existed for at least decades.  The legal system is held back by the technology lawyers _have_ adopted, sometimes enthusiastically and often at great voluntary expense, not by the tardiness of prophecized salvation for or from the profession.

There are many yolks to cast off.  I am particularly irked by this one.

Cut, Copy, and Paste.  Their humble wands of invocation---`Ctrl`, `C`, `X`, and `V`---shine, pearlescent from wear, on the keyboards of the young and old.  In their twinkling reflections of above-head fluorescent light, you can nearly make out the tears of the bygone scrivener, run off the grounds in the era of waistcoats.  The very symbol of law office dissent, Bartleby, vanquished!  Press away!

But Cut, Copy, and Paste were no revelations, except, perhaps, on iPhone.  Their graphical manifestations---"icons" of scissors, clipboards, stacked pages---allude to their tangible predecessors.  The photocopier.  Spirit duplicators.  Mimeo.  Carbon paper.  The printing press.  The [polygraph].  All spewing fodder for diligent slicer-dicer-pasters, plus a few less diligent casualties.

Cheap copying precedes cheap networking in the history of the computer, if not in history at large.  The improvement was incremental.  The typewriter went electric.  The electric typewriter metastasized into the word processor.  The word processor was contained in a terminal program for the mini, the personal computer, your rectangles.

Software has indeed "eaten" the office, but it has not been thoroughly digested.  [Skeuomorphs] abound.  What member of the papercraft pantheon has not been "implemented", "cloudified"?  The filing cabinet.  The bookmark.  The highlighter.  The mailbox.  A new "industry" has rendered them all, slavishly, in one less dimension.  Thus has the "twenty-first-century law office" become a cartoon of the twentieth's.  We are become cartoon characters, dashing through skipped frames from gag to gag at incredible perceived speed.

Bravo!  It's what we asked for.

Bravo!  It's what we paid for.

Bravo!  It's what we got.

Copying's a wicked high.  It pays quick and cheap, collects slow and dear.  Tolerance, dependence, and congenital copiers follow in its wake.  Ignore the easy cases:  Copying a bad precedent.  Forgetting what was changed.  Notice by undersea telegraph cable in mobile startup's bylaws.  The right form, or clause, or snippet, pasted in the correct place, costs more than its worth.

Preserving the provenance of any such copying entails ... more copies.  Among the copy-dependent, the answer is always "more copies".  File that Word doc at court?  PDF copy.  Start a new doc based on that filing?  Messed up Word copy.  Sending those changes to opposing?  Clean copy, redline copy.  Comparing to standard form?  In form copy, new copy.  Out messy copy copy.  Switching firms?   Copy, copy, copy.

Five copies are manageable.  Fifty copies are a nightmare.  Five hundred copies is hoarding.  How will you find what it is you think you've saved?

Copies do not have _identity_.  They can be confirmed as _identical_ only by comparison to other copies.  Which copies to compare?  Selection is always, to some extent, manual.  One initiates the automated process of comparison.  If copies differ in format---Word versus PDF, fuzzy PDF versus PDF---comparison is manual, too.  Buy a light table.  Use a window, hope the sun still shines.  Hire a paralegal.  Not too young; they'll quit.

Even best case, the act of comparing does not reduce the number of copies, even identical copies.  Best case, the number of copies stays the same.  There is no new copy showing nonexistent differences.  A ratchet.  Copy accretion.

The alternative to copying is _reference_.  Reference to a copy---the file located _here_---is just a copy with indirection.  But reference by identity is no copy at all.  "We agree to _this version_ of _these terms_.  I don't care where you get your copy."  Net savings:  At least one copy.  Copy attrition.

Reference, back in the day when the profession was busy getting its Word (or WordPerfect) on, was a dick move.  Great, thanks for referencing that "standard" industry form.  I don't have a subscription, and it takes three days and a few hundred to get one.  Oh, you were on the drafting committee?  Why the Hell didn't you put it on the floppy?  Why the Hell didn't you send it FedEx?  Notice.  Merger.  Meeting of the minds.  Asshole.

The copy-computers had proliferated.  They did not yet converse.  These days, the answer to "Where did you get your copy?" is always the same.  You got it on the Internet, the same way you got the reference.  It's in your pocket, for Chrissake.

One way to identify by reference is to appeal to some standardizing authority.  "Version such-and-such of the American Institute of Architect's such-and-such form."  Depend on the AIA to crush any troglodyte promulgating rubbish under its name.  Realistically, nobody gives a damn.  Nobody will try.  In the mode:  "The such-and-such year revision of the ISDA Master Agreement."  "The FAR provisions at such-and-such C.F.R. such-and-such, as of current date."  This works well if you want to reference terms "off the shelf" and they are actually on a shelf somewhere.  Say, the Library of Congress.

Of course you don't.  You need to mess with the standard.  Your particularly perverse, customized edit is the deal.  Or you're pretending your perverse, customized edit _is_ a standard.  God bless Procurement.

We have the technology.  We have since the seventies.  The technology is called [cryptographic hash functions].  Just think "fingerprint".  Anything in cartoon land---anything you type with the keyboard---goes into the "hash function".  Out pops a "fingerprint", probably much shorter than what went in.  Unlike actual fingerprints, these are pretty spot-on for unique identification.  There aren't any people doing their best "unfailingly objective" impression involved.  Just cold, hard Zeppelin-era software.

If you find a way to come up with documents that fingerprint however you want, quit law, pillage whatever computer-based payment system strikes your fancy, and retire to a private island.  The world, collectively, is betting a Hell of a lot more than whatever your deal is worth---whatever your deal is worth---on these hash functions.  If they tank, don't stress over your bar license.  Square with the higher power in whose ammunition you have invested.
