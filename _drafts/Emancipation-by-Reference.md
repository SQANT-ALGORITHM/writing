I am an "impending death of the legal profession" cynic.  I do not believe that new technology---"expert systems", "AI", "machine learning", "deep neural networks"---will eat lawyerdom as we know it.

If you asked me to spec out what any such system would have to do to replace, rather than augment, the core value proposition of a single respected colleague, I couldn't deliver.  Nor is there a training set on hand.  Feed your net [Christensen](https://lccn.loc.gov/96010894) and [Susskind](https://lccn.loc.gov/96017176) and you will get ... more [Christensen](https://lccn.loc.gov/2011008440) and [Susskind](https://lccn.loc.gov/2012540370), or something like it.  As for what large networked systems can and will be trained to do: I look forward to using them.

Cynicism about the legal profession's efficacy, on the other hand, is mandatory.  The facts compel it.

Fortunately, all the fundamental technology required for an efficient, accessible, ethically laudable American legal profession---in law and in software---has existed for at least decades.  The legal system is held back by the technology lawyers _have_ adopted, sometimes enthusiastically and often at great voluntary expense, not by the tardiness of prophecized salvations for or from the profession.

Cut, Copy, and Paste.  The humble plastic wands of their invocation---`Ctrl`, `C`, `X`, and `V`---glint, pearlescent from wear, on the keyboards of young and old.  In their twinkling reflections of above-head fluorescent light, you can nearly make out the tears of the bygone scrivener, run out of work.  The very symbol of law office dissent, Bartleby, vanquished!

But Cut, Copy, and Paste were no revelations.  Their graphical manifestations---"icons" of scissors, clipboards, stacked pages---allude to their tangible predecessors.  The photocopier.  Spirit duplicators.  Mimeo.  Carbon paper.  The printing press.  The [polygraph].  All spewing fodder for diligent slicer-dicer-pasters, plus a few less diligent casualties.

Cheap copying precedes cheap networking in the history of the computer, if not in history at large.  The improvement was incremental.  The typewriter went electric.  The electric typewriter begat the word processor.  The word processor became a program on the terminal, the personal computer, your personal computer.

Software has indeed "eaten" the office.  [Skeuomorphs] abound.  What member of the papercraft pantheon has not been "implemented", cloudified?  The filing cabinet.  The color-coded label.  The bookmark.  The highlighter.  The mailbox.  A new "industry" has rendered them all, lovingly, in one less dimension.
