I am a lawyer.  I write software.  I am an "impending death of the legal profession" nonbeliever.  New technology---"expert systems", "AI", "machine learning", "deep neural networks"---will not eat lawyerdom as we know it.  At least not as lawyers know it.

If you asked me to spec out what any such system would have to do to replace, rather than augment, the core value proposition of a single respected colleague, I couldn't deliver.  Nor is there a training set on hand.  Feed your net [Christensen](https://lccn.loc.gov/96010894) and [Susskind](https://lccn.loc.gov/96017176) and you will get ... more [Christensen](https://lccn.loc.gov/2011008440) and [Susskind](https://lccn.loc.gov/2012540370), or uncanny simulacra.  As for what large networked systems can and will be trained to do: I look forward to delegating my drudgework.

Cynicism about the legal profession's efficacy, on the other hand, is mandatory.  The facts compel it.  And a great deal of pain.

Fortunately, all the fundamental technology required for an efficient, accessible, ethically laudable American legal profession---in law and in software---has existed for at least decades.  The legal system is held back by the technology lawyers _have_ adopted, sometimes enthusiastically and often at great voluntary expense, not by the tardiness of prophecized salvation for or from the profession.

There are many yolks to cast off.  I am particularly irked by one.

Cut, Copy, and Paste.  Their humble wands of invocation---`Ctrl`, `C`, `X`, and `V`---shine, pearlescent from wear, on the keyboards of the young and old.  In their twinkling reflections of overhead light, you can nearly make out the tears of the redundant scrivener.  The very symbol of law office dissent, Bartleby, vanquished!

But Cut, Copy, and Paste were no revelations.  Their graphical manifestations---"icons" of scissors, clipboards, stacked pages---allude to their tangible predecessors.  The photocopier.  Spirit duplicators.  Mimeo.  Carbon paper.  The printing press.  The [polygraph].  All spewing fodder for diligent slicer-dicer-pasters, plus a few less diligent casualties.

Cheap copying precedes cheap networking in the history of the computer, if not in history at large.  The improvement was incremental.  The typewriter went electric.  The electric typewriter became word processor.  The word processor reduced to software ... for the mini, for the PC, for the rectangles in our pockets.

Software has indeed "eaten" the office, but it has not been thoroughly digested.  [Skeuomorphs] abound.  What member of the papercraft pantheon has not been "implemented", then "cloudified"?  The filing cabinet.  The bookmark.  The highlighter.  The mailbox.  A new "industry" has rendered them all, slavishly, in one less dimension.  Thus has the "twenty-first-century law office" become a cartoon of the twentieth's.  And we are become cartoon characters, dashing from punchline to punchline at incredible perceived speed.

Bravo!  It's what we asked for.

Bravo!  It's what we paid for.

Bravo!  It's what we got.

Copying's a wicked high.  It pays quick and cheap, collects slow and dear.  Tolerance, dependence, and congenital copiers follow in its wake.  Ignore the easy cases:  Copying a bad precedent.  Forgetting what was changed.  Notice by undersea telegraph cable in mobile startup's bylaws.  The right form, or clause, or snippet, pasted in the correct place, costs more than it should.

Preserving the provenance of any such copying entails ... more copies.  In fact, among the copy-dependent, the answer is always "more copies".  File that Word doc at court?  PDF copy.  Start a new doc based on that filing?  Messed up Word copy.  Sending those changes to opposing?  Clean copy, redline copy.  Comparing to standard form?  In form copy.  In new copy.  Out messy comparison copy.  Switching firms?   Copy, copy, copy.

Five copies are manageable.  Fifty copies are a nightmare.  Five hundred copies is hoarding.  How will you find what it is you think you've saved?

Copies do not have _identity_.  They can be confirmed as _identical_ only by comparison to other copies.  Selection of copies to compare is always, to some extent, manual.  The process of comparison, however automated, initiates manually.  If copies differ in format---Word versus PDF, fuzzy PDF versus PDF---comparison is manual, too.  Buy a light table.  Use a window, hope the sun still shines.  Hire a paralegal.

Even best case, the act of comparing does not reduce the number of copies.  Even if copies prove identical, trashing one means trashing our record that the same content appeared in that context.  So best case, to preserve the same information, the number of copies stays the same.  There is no new copy showing nonexistent differences.  A ratchet.  Copy accretion.

The alternative to copying is _reference_.  Reference to a copy---the file located _here_---is just a copy with indirection.  But reference by identity is no copy at all.  "We agree to _this version_ of _these terms_.  I don't care where you get your copy."  Net savings:  At least one copy.  Copy attrition.

Reference, back in the day when the profession was busy getting its Word and WordPerfect on, was a dick move.  Great, thanks for referencing that "standard" industry form.  I don't have a subscription, and it takes three days and a few hundred to get one.  Oh, you were on the drafting committee?  Why the Hell didn't you put it on the floppy?  Why the Hell didn't you send it FedEx?  Notice.  Merger.  Meeting of the minds.  Asshole.

The copy-computers had proliferated.  They did not yet converse.  Copy was cheap, networking, and therefore reference resolution, still slow and expensive.

But these days, the answer to "Where did you get your copy?" is always the same.  You got it on the Internet, the same way you got the reference.  It's in your pocket, for Chrissake.  And the device in your pocket has less storage space---space for copies---than what it replaced.  But we've all got one, because Internet access is worth more than copy space.  We can refer to a seemingly infinite store of knowledge.  We need copy only little, if any, of it.

One way to identify by reference is to appeal to some standardizing authority.  "Version such-and-such of the American Institute of Architect's such-and-such form."  In the mode:  "The such-and-such year revision of the ISDA Master Agreement."  "The FAR provisions at such-and-such C.F.R. such-and-such, as of current date."  In relying on such a reference to lead to a particular set of terms---to _identify_ the terms intended---is to rely on the AIA, ISDA, the federal government, &c. to crush any miscreants brazen enough to pass counterfeits.  Realistically, miscreants have better scams.  Very rarely will anyone try.  This kind of reference already works well if you want to reference terms "off the shelf" and they are actually on a shelf somewhere.  Say, the Library of Congress.

Of course you don't.  You need to mess with the standard.  Your particularly perverse, customized edit is the deal.  Or you're pretending your perverse, customized edit is a standard.

We have the technology.  We have since the seventies.  The technology is called [cryptographic hash functions].  Just think "fingerprint".  Anything in cartoon land---anything you type with the keyboard---goes into the "hash function".  Out the other end pops a "hash".  Hashes tend to get written out like this:

    46b8a77c7e34191162ea26fddb7d89ea92ca9d0f

Here is a box, where you can type anything:

<textarea id="input" style="width:100%" placeholder="Type anything here.">There's a lady who's sure...</textarea>

Here is a "hash" of the text in the box above:

<pre class="highlight"><code id="hash"></code></pre>

<script>
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  var input = document.getElementById('input')
  input.addEventListener('input', onInput)
  onInput({ target: input }) })

function onInput(event) {
  var value = event.target.value
  var display = document.getElementById('hash')
  if (value.length === 0) {
    display.textContent = 'Hash will appear here.' }
  else {
    var buffer = new TextEncoder('utf-8').encode(value)
    window.crypto.subtle.digest({ name: 'SHA-1' }, buffer)
    .then(function(hash){ display.textContent = toHex(hash) })
    .catch(function(error){
      console.error(error) }) } }

function toHex(arrayBuffer) {
  var hexadecimal = ''
  var dataView = new DataView(arrayBuffer)
  var length = dataView.byteLength
  for (var index = 0; index < length; index++) {
    var character = dataView.getUint8(index).toString(16)
    hexadecimal += character }
  return hexadecimal }
</script>

Unlike actual fingerprints, these are pretty spot-on for unique identification.  There aren't any experts matching these fingerprints on the basis of emphatically "objective" criteria.  Just cold, hard, Led Zeppelin-era software machinery.

If you find a way to come up with documents that fingerprint---"hash"---however you want, quit law, pillage the online payment system of your choice, and retire to a private island.  The world, collectively, is betting a Hell of a lot more than whatever your deal is worth---whatever your deal is worth---on these hash functions.  If they tank, don't stress over your bar license.  Square with the higher power of your understanding.

You may be thinking:  These fingerprints, they look like nonsense.  I can't tell them apart.  I can't keep even a one of them in my head.

You're right, they're not exactly catchy three-minute pop tunes.  The computers have no trouble with them---they're an incredibly cheap way to store references---but a compute that dutifully summons a California separation agreement where you needed a Japanese ForEx master isn't much help.  Time to learn the two-step.

First, consult reliable source for a list of useful references.  If you need a venture capital financing document, that might mean the website of the National Venture Capital Association.  For a standard corporate form, perhaps the site of your local Secretary of State's office.  You might even check a book.

What you expect to find is a kind of fingerprint database.  Running with the NVCA hypothetical, you might find:

> There is an organization called "National Venture Capital Organization".
>
> That organization has published two versions of a form called "Model Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement".
>
> One is called the "December 10, 2015" version.  Its "fingerprint" is:
>
>     4cbd040533a2f43fc6691d773d510cda70f4126a
>
> Another is called the "February 21, 2016" version.  Its "fingerprint" is:
>
>     5d3386c5b755adc02afcd922c4ff383b8850fbbc

If you and I refer to the "the February 21, 2016 version of the National Venture Capital Association's Model Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement".
