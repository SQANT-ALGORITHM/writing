I am an "impeding death of the legal profession" cynic.  I do not believe that technology---"AI", "machine learning", "expert systems", flavor du jour---will eat lawyerdom as we know it.

Partly that's because I'm a practicing lawyer, and whatever intellectually pleasing but functionally impractical generalities I once entertained about law practice have long since boiled off.  If you asked me to draw up a loose functional spec for software that replaces even a single competent lawyer, I couldn't do it.  But it's mostly because I write software to try to solve some discrete problems in my own practice, and know from experience that success is far from inevitable.

There's no sex in recognizing what technology hath really wrought over the past few decades:  It has given lawyers more of what they want, faster, and for less money.  The scriveners have been run out.  As have a great many paralegals, secretaries, mailpeople, clerks.  Increasingly, despite their valiant, self-induced evolution, also law librarians.  Is this a difference of kind, or a higher degree of what we had?  Is it making bad habits easier and cheaper to reinforce, or prompting systematic reassessment?

Consider how many of the systems lawyers actually employ to do their work translate directly back to the paper processes from which they evolved.  It's easy to pick on systems that spit out PDFs---the court and state agency filing system, case law research systems, secondary material archives---they're only the most obvious.  [Skeuomorphs] abound, from e-mail to word processors. There may be fewer papercraft gadgets on our desks these days, and Word Processing isn't what it used to be.  But mostly the things that have disappeared have reappeared in software somewhere on our other "desktops".  The icons we click to use them often allude to the actual devices we used to pick up and use.

But I am not without hope.
