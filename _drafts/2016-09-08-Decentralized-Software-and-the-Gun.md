Every once in a blue moon, some red-blooded Texan will make the news
with a good old fashioned, full-throated call for secession from the
United States of America.  As a Texan, it's hard to explain to others
that both statement and coverage are both practically meaningless
and absolutely essential.  There is no good case for secession from
the United States, but Texas has to make on like a credible threat.
What others make of the show is quite beside the point.  The words
are national politics, but the point is decidedly local.

The issue, or rather the sentiment, is _independence_.  Like so many
folks, Texans can't describe who they think they are in any concrete
terms.  Independence is not a concrete term.  Try to define it;
it washes out in the abstract.  Try to make it practical; it boils
down to a less heinous crop of dependencies than the other guy has.
Independence is a _feeling_.  We've all felt it, and we know it
by name.  The name is enough.

---

Texas, the culture, is high on independence.  And by simple, inexorable
implication, Texans love The Gun.

Firearms, especially concealed handguns, and their cut-strength
surrogates---tasers, knives, any and everything "tactical"---are
recreational drugs of independence in an age of many-billion-dollar war
machines and drones that kill.  Give Any Average Joe a 9 mm handgun,
convince him he knows how to use it, and he'll walk straighter,
talk louder, and generally go about life  like he's got an edge.
It's a simple psychosomatic reflex.

The difference is roughly proportional to the noise floor of
anxiety Average Joe labors under.  Nightly news?  Six inches taller.
Cable news?  Twenty more pounds of imputed muscle.  Gangs, terrorists,
sociopaths, immigrants, militant black people, communists galore
and sundry bugbears recorded and replayed out of all proportion?
[Sheepdog].  [Oath Keeper].  [Prepper].  Shocks to livelihood,
prospects, or simple "comforts of home" compound.

For every self-reinforcing anxiety, The Gun affords a correspondingly
self-reinforcing illusion of control.  The conceivable horrors are
limited only by the well-stoked imagination, and so, in the absence
of faith and empowering knowledge, is the power of the gun.  The Gun
engages the same machinery of imagination.

Plus, guns are a hell of a lot of fun.  Industry upon industry
attests to this: The guns themselves.  The ammo.  The accessories.
The training.  The tapes.  The message boards.  The gear.  The people.
All feeding back into each other, into politics, into the market.

To be seducible by all this is to be human, as natural as the
feeling of recognition for a good deed done or the hazy mirth of
a Cannabis high.  The Gun proclivity transcends gender, station,
specific predisposition to guns, even politics and self-image.
Storied and persistent institutions---cultural, historical, blithely
and obstreperously commercial---exist to provide a casual and low-cost
induction, backed up by depth enough to sink a life's worth of pastime.
The first hit, in any sane market, is free or very close to it.

And I hold out hope that amongst the Gun Addicts, the heavy users
and doomed experimenters, are those who can hold The Gun and feel
nothing, or whose feelings correspond to the limited reality of
The Gun in practice.  Those who, by virtue of the familiarity of
long-lived experience, reflection, or stout ethical, spiritual
fortitude, can hold and carry The Gun without feeling a high.
Can expound on its [history and its intricacies][history] without a
hint of [power fantasy].  Can drive the Gun sober, so to speak.

I deny myself the fun of The Gun precisely because I can't.  The Gun
is never just a gun in my mind.  That realization was not quick in
coming.  But the Gun in my hand, in my closet, in my imagination, is
first and foremost a weapon of violence, a drug inducing fantasies of
an indifferent, caricature of a man I would otherwise abhor to be.
_Mea culpa_.  But I am not alone in sin, as I was not alone is
self-delusion.

---

In the confines of an indulgent imagination, there is little harm.
But The Gun causes men weak as I am to _secede_ in very practical ways.
For each unbounded, otherwise unanswered fear sated by _the feeling
of The Gun_ affords no motivation, inspires no realism, makes the
performance of conscience no more urgent to address those sources of
anxiety that feed the root of the addiction.

The feeling of The Gun becomes a self-fulfilling fantasy, but the
fantasy, reduced to lived experience, resolves to a nightmare.
If I load up on feelings of individual empowerment, through guns
or otherwise, I mask in myself every feeling that would inspire
contribution to a true state of affairs in which The Gun loses its
appeal.  And that minor withdrawal, distributed among many, hastens a
precipitous decline toward those dire circumstances where The Gun will
be tested as the backstop for the independence we crave, and will fail.

If we mask our anxieties about crime in our communities with guns,
we stop facing up the real-world complexities of the problem.  If we
cache arms in preparation for collapse of the rule of law, we're
less likely to vote, and in fact our actions vote no confidence in
the common enterprise.  Conversely, the nonviolent commitment poses
its own risk of error.  But given the facts of politics and the
nature of our biases, the nonviolent path seems the more accurate.
It is certainly the more optimistic, personally and as a community.

My California friends tend to scoff at all these palpitations.
Texas is a long way from California, on The Gun and other matters.
But California, like Texas, fetishizes _direct action_---grand,
irrefutable masterstrokes of empowered individuals with tectonic
ramifications---at the expense of East-Coastal, Rocky-esque hero
quests featuring knife fighters of indomitable grit toughing it
out through hordes of narrowly weaker opposition.  In California,
direct action tends toward the form of subversive or otherwise highly
compelling _mass media_, of which _computer software_ is now a firmly
established genre.

Slicing off just the software part of the equation---reflecting
northern California particularly---the most obvious example of modern
direct-action power fantasists must be the cryptoanarchists. The
cryptoanarchists, to do some injustice by generalization, worship
[one-way functions].  One-way functions are computable tasks that
are much, much easier to work forward, from staring point to result,
than backward, from result to starting point, much in the same way a
sandcastle is easier to wreck than to build, a gun easier to use than
to defend against.  Another Great Equalizer.

[one-way functions]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function

The catechism of cryptoanarchism is that this imbalance is
natural, irremediable, and easily bestowed upon the Common Man, and
therefore deployable to empower Common Man in redress of the power
imbalance between state and individual.  Cryptography can protect a
whistleblower's disclosure of documents, whether the corporation likes
it or not, keep an individual's encrypted e-mail secret from prying
government eyes, whether the government likes it or not.  [Wikileaks].
[PGP].  [Encrypting all Internet traffic][letsencrypt].  And so on.

In more recent terms, and divorced somewhat from the politics and
personalities of the cryptoanarchists as a particular group, are
various efforts to "decentralize" software and essential services.
The most direct descendants of the original cryptoanarchists are those
technologies, like Bitcoin and other applications of "blockchain"
data structures with distributed consensus, that focus primarily on
wresting key financial and commercial functions from suspicion-leaden
intermediaries like banks, payment networks, and financial regulators.
These themes speak to the peculiar political concerns of wide veins
in the community, given especially that such institutions are broadly
and deeply entangled with government and other vessels of imbalanced
power any good anarchist must detest.  By chance, those of certain
"right-wing" persuasions---libertarians of various stripes---are
similar predisposed, leading to a legion, highly energetic, often
toxic, and perhaps self-destructive "cyrptocurrency" milieu.

But specific interest in distributed consensus protocols and data
structures based on one-way functions, like blockchains, also
intersected with brisk developments in the area of distributed
databases, termed "NoSQL" in industry.  Leaps and bounds there took
wind primarily from enormous, data-heavy corporate technology concerns,
especially Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and their ilk, who for sundry
reasons or more or less enlightened self-interest made much ado of
publishing technical papers and code for many fundamental advances.
These, in turn, revived interest in theretofore nice academic work.

The result is a general sense that distributed systems, especially
peer-to-peer systems on the model of BitTorrent, are inherently
virtuous, but now, thanks to fortuitous combinations of morsels from
the corporate table, also capable.  This is held true quite without
reference to any peculiar problem or particular power imbalance.
Whether the issue be security, privacy, or user autonomy, the promise
of distributed software is panacea, even if those properties remain
unrealized and untested, and though all involved admit that the
subtleties of security based on cryptography are difficult to grasp
and unamenable to principled, as opposed to practical, proof.  Much is
made of "reform" of the Internet's once inherently censorship-resistant
architecture, which currently supports rampant censorship just fine,
and to the supposed privacy benefits of peer-to-peer networks, many
of which incorporate unforgeable signatures and IP address disclosure
as fundamental principles of operation.

These technologies are fiendishly interesting, technically enthralling,
and perfect analogs for the Gun.  Whether we pin our hopes on
[locking in future generations to incentives we devise][On Stake],
[reengineering the World Wide Web][IPFS], or simply replacing each
service with servers with a service without, to pin our hopes thus
is in many ways to embrace the _feeling_ of independence ascribed to
those implementation details, and to abdicate motivation to improve,
or believe in, institutions created and monitored collaboratively.
