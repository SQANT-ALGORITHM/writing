Every once in a blue moon, some red-blooded Texan will make the news
with a good old fashioned, full-throated call for secession from the
United States of America.  As a Texan, it's hard to explain to others
not so blessed and burdened that the practiced political ritual of
finding and amplifying such a lout is both practically meaningless and,
culturally, absolutely essential.  There is no good case to be made
for Texas' secession from the United States.  But it is absolutely
essential that Texas make on, recurrently, like a credible threat.
What others make of the show, if anything at all, is quite beside
the point.  It's a feckless exercise in national politicking for the
sake of identity politics entirely local.

The issue, or rather the sentiment, is _independence_.  Like so
many folks, Texans stand at a loss to describe how they aim to
go about life without relapse into laughably nonspecific terms.
Independence is such a term.  Try to define it; it washes out in the
abstract ... fuck-you money, good health, and a very fortuitous roll
of fortune's dice [be damned].  Try to make it practical; it boils
down to a less heinous crop of dependencies than the other guy has.
Dependent on the job, but not on the bottle.  Dependent on neighbors,
but not tied up in debt.

Independence is a _feeling_.  We've all felt it, here and there,
and we know it by name.  The meaning is plain enough without more
words that miss the mark.  Heaps of analytical exposition don't make
it any more clear.

---

Texas, the culture, is high on independence.  And by simple, inexorable
implication, Texas, as a culture, loves the Gun.

Guns, especially concealed handguns, and their cut-strength
cousins---tasers, knives, any and everything "tactical"---are
recreational drugs of independence in an age of many-million-dollar
war machines and drones that kill.  Give Average Joe a 9 mm handgun,
convince him he knows how to use it---not hard, the boob tube
furnishing much good material for any would-be Walter Mitty---and he'll
walk straighter, talk louder, and generally go about life like he's
second in command after God's own Angel Michael, even at Wal-Mart.
At least for a while.

The extent of effect is roughly proportional to the noise floor
of anxiety induced in the man.  Nightly news?  Six inches taller.
Cable news?  Twenty more pounds of imputed muscle.  Gangs, terrorists,
sociopaths, immigrants, militant black people, communists galore
and sundry bugbears recorded and replayed out of all proportion?
[Sheepdog].  [Oath Keeper].  [Prepper].  On an individual level, none
of these is morally reprehensible.  They may be closer to inevitable.

For every nightmare, the Gun affords a correspondingly unbounded
illusion of control, a magical antidote to helplessness, the mask of a
stock Decisive Hero.  The conceivable horrors are unbounded, and so,
in the absence of faith and empowering knowledge, must the power of
our talismans be.  Else it's life upon our knees, all dependence,
because there are no alternatives.

Plus, the Gun is a hell of a lot of fun.  Industry upon industry
attests to this: The Guns.  The Ammo.  The noise.  The kick.
The Accessories.  The training.  The tapes.  The message boards.
_The gear_.  _The people_.  All feeding back into each other, into
the politics, into the market.

To be seducible by all this is to be human.  The proclivity transcends
gender, station, specific predisposition, even politics and self-image.
Storied and persistent institutions---cultural, historical, blithely
and obstreperously commercial---exist to provide a casual and low-cost
induction, backed up by depth enough to sink a life's worth of pastime.
The first hit, in any sane market, is free or very close to it.

And I hold out hope that amongst the addicts, the heavy users
and doomed experimenters, are those who can hold the Gun and feel
nothing, or whose feelings correspond to shared reality.  Those who,
by virtue of the familiarity of long-lived experience, reflection,
or stout ethical, spiritual fortitude, can hold and carry the
Gun without feeling the High.  Can expound on its [history and
its intricacies][history] without a hint of [power fantasy] or
reinforcement of it in others.  Can drive the Gun sober, so to speak.

I deny myself the fun of the Gun precisely because I am not one
of those blessed few.  That small feat of self-assessment was not
quick in the coming.  But the Gun in my hand, in my closet, in my
imagination, is first and foremost a weapon of violence, a drug
inducing fantasies of an indifferent, caricature of a man I would
otherwise abhor to be.  _Mea culpa_.  But I am not alone in sin,
as I was not alone is self-delusion.

---

In the confines of an indulgent imagination, there is little harm.
But the Gun causes men weak as I am to _secede_.  For each unbounded,
otherwise unanswered fear sated by _the feeling of the Gun_ affords no
motivation, inspires no realism, makes the performance of conscience
no more urgent to address those sources of anxiety that feed the root
of the addiction.  If the question is troublesome, in the Gun I had
my answer.  One feeling answers another, though one be grounded---to
a point, the fear---and the other be fancy---all the palliatives of
the Gun.

The feeling of the Gun becomes a self-fulfilling fantasy, but the
fantasy, reduced to lived experience, resolves to a nightmare.  If I
accumulate individual power, in the form of the Gun or otherwise,
I mask in myself every feeling that would inspire contribution
to a true state of affairs in which the Gun serves no purpose.
In dependence upon the feeling induced by the Gun, I permit myself
to abdicate participation in the project of rendering the Gun moot.
And that minor withdrawal, distributed amongst many fellows, hastens
a precipitous decline toward those dire circumstances where the Gun
will be tested, and will fail.

So is crime a blight, striking many unjustly?  Surely it is, in
whatever measure it occurs, however much we perceive it.  With the gun,
I can delude myself, extolling my own preparation, inflating whatever
paltry marginal risk it erases.  Without it, I must have faith, or
else take action, in life rather than daydreams, that benefits not
just me and mine, but all.  To increase the safety of my community,
the support and stability of my neighbors, the proper functioning of
those entrusted---and trained, soberly---to protect and thereby deter.
To reduce the hate, poverty, desperation that leads beyond peace
and reason.

Might the government turn against our liberties, compelling rather than
heeding the needs of the people?  Surely it might, and in some measure
has and always has.  Shall I cache arms for a hopeless struggle, past
the rule of law?  If I do, what force will inspire me to work against
that outcome, to apply myself to good governance, right decisions,
the vote, and rule of law?  Is a vault of extrajudicial death tools
not a vote of no confidence in our project of collective governance,
by assent?  Is that patriotism?

It is popular among folk my age, with no small reason, to cast
aspersions on august institutions among our inheritance.  Be it
Congress, city council, the professions, even God, expectations have
left us wanting.  All the wood-paneled walls seem to rot, creak,
and groan.  And in each facet of life intersecting with power, a
terrible, spontaneous scientific method wrought of man's unbounded
ambition and the rigidity of antique checks and balances ceaselessly
degrades every limit conducive to virtue.  Though, in the absolute,
much of these fair United States functions such as to be envied far
and wide, we perceive only the motion of our ship, not the distance
already traveled.  What has America done for its Americans _lately_?

Texas is a long way from California.  But California, like Texas,
fetishizes _direct action_---grand, irrefutable masterstrokes with
tectonic ramifications---at the expense of East-Coastal, Rocky-esque
hero quests featuring knife fighters of indomitable grit toughing
it out through hordes of narrowly weaker opposition.  In California,
direct action tends toward the form of subversive or otherwise highly
compelling _mass media_, of which _computer software_ is now a firmly
established genre.

Slicing off just the software part of the equation---reflecting
northern California particularly---the most obvious example of modern
direct-action power fantasists must be the cryptoanarchists. The
cryptoanarchists, to do some injustice by generalization, worship
[one-way functions].  One-way functions are computable tasks that
are much, much easier to work forward, from staring point to result,
than backward, from result to starting point, much in the same way
a sandcastle is easier to wreck than to build.

[one-way functions]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function

The catechism of cryptoanarchism is that this imbalance is
natural, irremediable, and easily bestowed upon the Common Man, and
therefore deployable to empower Common Man in redress of the power
imbalance between state and individual.  Cryptography can protect a
whistleblower's disclosure of documents, whether the corporation likes
it or not, keep an individual's encrypted e-mail secret from prying
government eyes, whether the government likes it or not.  [Wikileaks].
[PGP].  [Encrypting all Internet traffic][letsencrypt].  And so on.

In more recent terms, and divorced somewhat from the politics and
personalities of the cryptoanarchists as a particular group, are
various efforts to "decentralize" software and essential services.
The most direct descendants of the original cryptoanarchists are those
technologies, like Bitcoin and other applications of "blockchain"
data structures with distributed consensus, that focus primarily on
wresting key financial and commercial functions from suspicion-leaden
intermediaries like banks, payment networks, and financial regulators.
These themes speak to the peculiar political concerns of wide veins
in the community, given especially that such institutions are broadly
and deeply entangled with government and other vessels of imbalanced
power any good anarchist must detest.  By chance, those of certain
"right-wing" persuasions---libertarians of various stripes---are
similar predisposed, leading to a legion, highly energetic, often
toxic, and perhaps self-destructive "cyrptocurrency" milieu.

But specific interest in distributed consensus protocols and data
structures based on one-way functions, like blockchains, also
intersected with brisk developments in the area of distributed
databases, termed "NoSQL" in industry.  Leaps and bounds there took
wind primarily from enormous, data-heavy corporate technology concerns,
especially Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and their ilk, who for sundry
reasons or more or less enlightened self-interest made much ado of
publishing technical papers and code for many fundamental advances.
These, in turn, revived interest in theretofore nice academic work.

The result is a general sense that distributed systems, especially
peer-to-peer systems on the model of BitTorrent, are inherently
virtuous, but now, thanks to fortuitous combinations of morsels from
the corporate table, also capable.  This is held true quite without
reference to any peculiar problem or particular power imbalance.
Whether the issue be security, privacy, or user autonomy, the promise
of distributed software is panacea, even if those properties remain
unrealized and untested, and though all involved admit that the
subtleties of security based on cryptography are difficult to grasp
and unamenable to principled, as opposed to practical, proof.  Much is
made of "reform" of the Internet's once inherently censorship-resistant
architecture, which currently supports rampant censorship just fine,
and to the supposed privacy benefits of peer-to-peer networks, many
of which incorporate unforgeable signatures and IP address disclosure
as fundamental principles of operation.

These technologies are fiendishly interesting, technically enthralling,
and perfect analogs for the Gun.  Whether we pin our hopes on
[locking in future generations to incentives we devise][On Stake],
[reengineering the World Wide Web][IPFS], or simply replacing each
service with servers with a service without, to pin our hopes thus
is in many ways to embrace the _feeling_ of independence ascribed to
those implementation details, and to abdicate motivation to improve,
or believe in, institutions created and monitored collaboratively.
