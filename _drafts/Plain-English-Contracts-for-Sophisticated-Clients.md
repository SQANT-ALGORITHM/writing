For reasons I've never understood, it is easy to relegate plain English contract drafting to consumer contract work.  Everyday people, as a rule, don't have and can't afford lawyers, so speaking the law-talk their way breeds confusion, misunderstanding, and resentment.  But companies have lawyers who can law-talk to each other, and it's more efficient that way whenever Real Money is involved.  So the story goes.

It's nonsense.  Companies are made of people, just like your customer base.  Legalese breeds confusion, misunderstanding, and resentment among the people who _are_ your company.  It's the same problem, institutionalized.

The collective knowledge of nonlawyer folk at any sizable company---about business, product, services, clients, and the ways of the world generally---makes mincemeat out of any lawyer, including this one.  When you write company contracts, especially standard form contracts, in legalese, you agree to pay a toll.  Every time the wisdom of the great mass that is your company needs appear in your form agreement, you pay one of many business people to wait on one of a few lawyers, miscommunicate the first time, repeat until the delusion of understanding becomes mutual, and hopefully wind up with a decent legal translation of something decent for the company.

In other words, big, sophisticated, cutting edge clients pay more than anybody else.

Even stodgy, "traditional" deals lawyers implicitly recognize this fact. When a deal becomes operationally complex, that complexity ends up mostly in the schedules, statements of work, and other "business friendly" add-ons to the legal terms.  The businesspeople get to mark up and even "own" those documents, subject to lawyerly supervision.  Each document speaks its own language: finance for the finance people, network security for the network security people, &c. Complex precedence and document-conflict rules in the legal terms quarantine any strangeness and limit each document to its purpose in the overall scheme.
