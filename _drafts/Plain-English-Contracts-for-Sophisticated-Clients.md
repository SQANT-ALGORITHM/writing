For reasons I've never understood, it is easy to relegate plain English contract drafting to consumer contract work.  Everyday people, as a rule, don't have and can't afford lawyers, so speaking the law-talk their way breeds confusion, misunderstanding, and resentment.  But companies have lawyers who can law-talk to each other, and it's more efficient that way when Real Money's at stake.  So the story goes.

It's nonsense.  Companies are made of people, just like your customer base.  Legalese breeds confusion, misunderstanding, and resentment among the people who _are_ your company.  It's the same problem, institutionalized.

The collective knowledge of nonlawyer folk at any sizable company---about business, product, services, clients, and the ways of the world generally---dwarfs the value of any lawyer, including this one.  When you write company contracts, especially standard form contracts, in legalese, you agree to pay a toll.  Every time the wisdom of the great mass that is your company needs appear in your form agreement, you pay one of many business people to wait on one of a few lawyers, miscommunicate the first time, repeat until the delusion of understanding becomes mutual, and hopefully wind up with a serviceable legal translation of something non-terrible for the company.

It's [Telephone] crossed with [Google Translate Sings], and it determines your legal obligations at scale.  The cost, risk of malfunction, and ramifications of failure increase with the size and complexity of the business.

In other words, big, sophisticated, cutting edge clients pay more.  It's a self-imposed tax on the size and sophistication of your operation.

Even stodgy, "traditional" deals lawyers implicitly recognize this fact. When a deal becomes operationally complex, that complexity ends up in the schedules, statements of work, and other "business terms" add-ons to the legal core.  The businesspeople get to mark up and even "own" those documents, subject to lawyerly supervision.

Each document speaks its own language: finance for the finance people, network security for the network security people, and so on. Complex precedence and document-conflict rules in the legal terms quarantine any strangeness and limit each document to its purpose in the overall scheme.  Thus many fiefdoms are established, and each pays its tribute.

This approach recognizes that there is efficiency in letting specialists speak on specialized topics for themselves.  But it also surrenders the utility of the lawyer, who may not navigate the weeds of the add-on terms at all, or only at a cursory level.  It's true that the value of the specialist outweighs the value of the lawyer on the specialized topic.  But the deals lawyer is in many ways a generalist, and rarely has nothing of value to add when it comes to describing obligations and setting up governance for a lasting commercial relationship.

One approach to recouping lawyer value is to find and hire lawyers who are also specialists and sicking them on the specialized parts of the deal, too.  I've found some great business that way as a lawyer-programmer.  But people who screw up one profession and then pick law for round two are hard to come by.  "Find more mutant lawyer-specialists" isn't a strategy for mass effect.
