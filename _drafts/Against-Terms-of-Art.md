<!--

Rule: Terms given plain meaning, _unless_ there is a set legal
meaning.  Lay readers cannot tell what is and isn't a legal term of
art. E.g. "equity".

Write contracts so they explain themselves to the parties.

Terms of art are abstractions.  Abstractions leak.

Fewer terms of art than commonly thought.

Many are merely names for complex rules and doctrines that require
detailed research in practical application.
