_This post discusses politics._

I grew up in the bible belt attending nondenominational "community churches".  I was fortunate to have some great Jewish friends and role models, and turned resolutely to Quakerism when I left home.  But there's still some part of me, deep down, that's perplexed by any faith that doesn't proselytize.  Profoundly good news is rare.  If you've got it, why not share it?

The other great shaping force on my life is a series of moves.  Like the hammer blows of a blacksmith, moves from small-town Texas to Austin, Austin to Putin's Moscow, then to San Francisco, then to Oakland hardened and shaped me in ways too fundamental for me to understand.

From the converted attic where I live, I can see the fog-blurred skyline of San Francisco, a rare, fallible, but functioning-despite-itself boom town in a general economy of loss, contrition, and despair.  I can see the flats of Oakland, portioned like a TV dinner by the freeways and bridge ramps the protesters here so often picket and blockade.  In the distance, the contrived, zoned-low-height domesticity of Silicon Valley, whence The VC Money comes, where local politics suffocate housing supply, restrict transit lines, and strain in vain to keep the grit of The City and The Town at bay.  And I can hear the chirps of the pedestrian walk across Broadway, the artery of choice for the marchers who protested Trump three days this week.  The playground of the black-clad, break-stuff kids who steal the protesters' spotlight, because a cracked window or a bit of burning cardboard in Old Oakland, where I work, is how photojournalists get paid.  As I wash the smell of smoke and motor oil off my hands, glancing north, I can see Cal Berkeley's Sather Tower, commemorating ground zero of a political earthquake that still sends aftershocks of political nostalgia for sixty-and-older set.

None of this place is perfect.  It is loud, dirty, chaotic, often apparently mad.  A spontaneous human jambalaya of nationalities, languages, occupations, and extractions.  The bullshit factor is high.  As a rule, a might self-obsessed.  And well practiced in the aversion of its collective eye from very visible social problems.

Planners, we've got a few.  But no plan, conceived by an orderly human mind, would make the Bay Area.  No technocrat could survive the ballot measure system.  Only a Peter the Great would never mind the fault lines.

So there is no Bay Area plan.  Which may very well explain why the Bay Area works.

If the politics of America show a bitter strain, if those left behind by the economic changes of my lifetime are showing their numbers, The Bay Area is the kind of place that's "ahead" to that "behind".  It is not the only such beachhead, but it is most certainly one of them.  It stands among the diverse, urbane, coastal cities where jobs are to be had and money is to be made.  Perfect paragons of economic equity they are not, but hope remains.

That distinction isn't nearly as neat as the pattern-munging mind would like it to be, but in the language and symbolism of culture we speak these days, it carries an obvious correlation.  The Bay Area is a multicultural place.  To survive and thrive here, you have to make the best of that situation, personally and professionally.

Early on, I probably missed out on some likely friends by use of the word "oriental" in casual speech.  To my Texan ear, "Asian" seemed overgeneralized and coarse, tasteless lumping many different cultures together.  "Oriental" sounded preferably refined, academic.  But "oriental" evokes very painful history here.  I learned.

As a professional matter, I have learned, in dealing with clients, to look for a diverse cast.  If you make it to 10 people with a team of one ethnicity, by dint of simple statistics, chances are slim you're playing a broad, deep, and smart enough game to compete with all the other people worldwide who have Internet.

If you can't work comfortably with gay, trans, zealously political people, or others very different from yourself, categories for whom may not yet be widely available, you are going to have a very hard time here.  Fun times will be had without you.  Companies who hire the people you pass over will destroy you.  By the same mechanism, in gross, a brigade of highly desirable "undersirables" come flooding in each year.  The adversity they survived at home, plus the moxey to pack up and move, run with make badassery.  Thus the steel is tempered.[^1]

Correlation does not imply causation.  Causation one has to argue.  California can, does, and should argue vigorously that its openness, its tolerance, its flexibility, and its compassion are part and parcel of its dynamism.  It's not a mistake of culture affinity that tolerant places adapted, economically, in ways that less flexible, less integrated communities did not.  The cultural investments of California's way of life paid out long and rich.
