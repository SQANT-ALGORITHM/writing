If the _effects_, but not the terms, of a software license discriminate against users or uses, is software under that license "open source"?

If an open-source software project's fair-sounding terms _become_ discriminatory in time, does the software cease to be open source?

> The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

> > Rationale: In order to get the maximum benefit from the process, the maximum diversity of persons and groups should be equally eligible to contribute to open sources.  Therefore we forbid any open-source license from locking anybody out of the process.

> > Some countries, including the United States, have export restrictions for certain types of software.  An OSD-conformant license may warn licensees of applicable restrictions and remind them that they are obliged to obey the law; however, it may not incorporate such restrictions itself.

> 6\.  No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
>
> The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor.  For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.

> > \[OSD Annotations\]

> > Rationale: The major intention of this clause is to prohibit license traps that prevent open source from being used commercially.  We want commercial users to join our community, not feel excluded from it.
