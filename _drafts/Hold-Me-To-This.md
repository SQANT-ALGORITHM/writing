Open-source software left its mark on me long before law school.  Still I learn the damage done, the myriad ways a "lawyers' lawyer" I'll never be.  But then again, if there's any one reason I'm not yet in the poor house---or programming to pay the rent again---it's that software folks steeped in the same values seek me out.

Attorney-client relationships based on this connection are subtly different.  Trust is different.

One symptom:  These clients tend to read every document I give them.  Legal colleagues often find it hard to believe how often---and how thoroughly---this happens.  But it is never---not the first time, not the dozenth time---an omen of low or diminished trust.  Sometimes these clients apologize ... for the delay.  There's no offense, given or taken.

The act of review _is_ trusting.  Their

Another:  I make a great deal of work available online, primarily form agreements.  I do using the tools my clients are accustomed to using to develop software.  The tools store snapshots of every revision that I make.  Every mistake.  Every blind alley.  They are public.  And the public is free to criticize, correct, improve on what I've done.  Some of that work is painful to revisit---naive, poorly executed, even dangerous.  I am building on online museum of it.  It is visible worldwide.

Open-source software people and American lawyers fetishize very different kinds of authority.  Sure, software has its share of "[benevolent dictators for life][BDFL]".  Like judges, they make opinions that carry weight of their political authority publicly known.  But they are expected to show much, much more work.  It is the work shown, and not the result achieved, that undergirds trust.

Imagine if CSPAN not only had cameras at oral arguments and trials, but also in judge's conferences ... and copies of all the internal court e-mail about each opinion, drafts included.  Imagine if every decision of a court born of less transparent process were stripped of precedential weight.  Or if folks started filing into a new, upstart court across the street that makes more to-do of being open.  Snappy dress codes, fancy buildings, and all manner of hokey verbal decorum don't help in that world.  They mark the poser.

This is how "my kind of software people" want their community to function.  Granted, there are well known examples---recent [OpenSSL] vulnerabilities like [Heartbleed]---showing the raw material of accountability aren't sufficient to guarantee result.  But on the whole, at the level of ideals, culture, and values, work born of process deemed closed or opaque at nearly any stage---"proprietary software"---is inherently suspect.  As are programmers who don't submit their work to the public ordeal, though beginning to do so induces all manner of psychosomatic turmoil in the uninitiated.

A number of my clients seek me out precisely because I'm wired for this and other values of the community, as they are.  When I hand these folks dense agreements about securities, intellectual property, and commercial agreements, they are more likely to trust that I'm representing their goals and values in the system.  They also tend to read every word I prepare for them.  The frequency and completeness with which this happens tend to shock my somewhat skeptical legal colleagues.

Eventually, I end up giving them something---anything---that I've either reworked in a "plain language" style or written from scratch.  The reaction tends to
