To my eye, there are exactly two motorcycles worth buying new, off the lot, in 2017: Yamaha's SR400 and Honda's CB1100.

From Yamaha:

These new motorcycles, and only these new motorcycles, share two salient features.

1.  I do not think they look terrible.

2.  They explicitly allude to popular motorcycles of the 1970s, when motorcycles were much simpler than they are now, and bring some of that simplicity forward with them.

The Yamaha SR400 is a revival of the Yamaha SR500, first offered in 1978:

The 2017 uses fuel injection---an electronically controlled fuel valve that opens and closes to spray pressurized gasoline toward the engine---rather than a carburetor---a mechanical device that uses precisely calibrated, straw-like "jets" to mix fuel with air.

The CB1100 points back to the Honda CB750, perhaps the most influential consumer motorcycles of all time, from 1969:

Which begat the CB900F, for the 1980s:

Which begat the CB1000, for the 1990s:

The 2017 CB1100, like the 1969, is a four-cylinder motorcycle with a round headlight, an upright seating position, wire spokes, a large front wheel, generous chrome, and a long, flat seat.  The CB1100 lacks a kickstarter and features a contoured gas tank, bringing it up toward the 1980s CB900 and the 1990s CB1000.  The CB1100 is fuel injected, like the 2017 SR400, in part because modern emissions regulations do not yield to vintage stylists.  Like the later bikes, the CB1100 uses an oil cooler---the black, radiator-like grill just above the exhaust down tubes---to cool the hottest parts of the engine, but goes back to cooling fins---the ridges on the silver part of the engine, near the tank---like the old 750.  Overall, folks tend to "feel" that today's CB1100 harkens back to somewhere in the early 1980s.
