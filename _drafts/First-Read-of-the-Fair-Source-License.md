[Sourcegraph] has release a new standard form license, [The Fair Source License]. The text was written by a professional hero of mine, [Heather Meeker], whose excellent books on open-source licensing I often recommend to clients.

Here's the text of version 0.9 from [fair.io], with my thoughts sprinkled interline.

> **Fair Source License, version 0.9**

Versioning from the get-go is a really, really good idea. Licenses terms, even "simple" license terms like the MIT License and the original BSD license, have to change. You can either embrace a way to at least track that change, or end up with a loose "family" of texts that vary in unpredictable ways. That's exactly what "MIT license" and "BSD license" have become, despite the excellent work of [SPDX] to codify canonical license templates.

> Copyright Â© \[year\] \[copyright owner\]

The fill-in-the-blanks make The Fair Source License a license template, like The MIT License or BSD-style licenses. Other standard license terms, which I call "fixed terms", don't have any blanks to fill out. [Apache 2.0] and [GPL 3] are current examples. I prefer fixed terms, but understand The Fair Source License was meant to feel lightweight. I'd have followed the practice of MIT/BSD for it, too.

[Apache 2.0]: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt

[GPL 3]: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt

I like the clarity of "copyright owner". This begs the question of [work made for hire]. The software community in general has really fallen down in awareness of when a programmer's employer or client, rather than the programmer themself, needs to give a software license.

I think it's fair to say that most open-source projects under MIT- and BSD-style licenses get the copyright notice wrong. Either they omit it altogether, making the attribution terms nonsensical, misattribute ownership, fail to update for additional contributors, or some combination.

> Licensor: \[legal name of licensor\]

I can imagine getting client questions about whether and when "copyright owner" and "licensor" need to be different.

> Software: \[name software and version if applicable\]

I really like the idea of a template that calls out the need to actually identify the software it applies to, rather than just relying on distribution together with a LICENSE file. The original "solution" to this was license header comments, but I've had terrible luck getting anyone my age or younger add such a thing to their personal work. Marking a single, specific place to identify the software package, as a whole, that the license applies to echoes in [Apache 2.0]'s NOTICE file, which reinforces the idea that the terms of the license itself are fixed, and any "customization" goes elsewhere.

[Here's an example NOTICE file](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/NOTICE), for Apache's Kafka project. Unfortunately, I rarely see non-Apache Foundation projects make use of NOTICE. I suspect this partly because it puts another bookkeeping requirement on licensees. In their defense, at least larger Apache 2.0 projects without NOTICE files tend to be pretty good about using Apache 2.0's standard license header comment. I think the fact that The Apache Foundation standardized a header and mentions it in their license text goes a long way to inspiring that good behavior.

> Use Limitation: \[number\] users

The convention of referring to license terms as "Fair Source _n_", where _n_ is the number that goes in this blank, is plenty clever. It also helps reinforce that the number should be just a number, and not any kind of more complicated formula or schedule.

I'd like to see that convention expanded just a tad, to make sure it's also clear what version of the Fair Source Terms is being used. Perhaps "Fair Source 0.9/25", "Fair Source 0.9 for 25", or similar to mean "The Fair Source License, version 0.9, Use Limitation 25 users".
