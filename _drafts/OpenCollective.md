Everybody in nonprofit work likes the idea of "fiscal sponsorship".  To the uninitiated, it reads like the do-gooder answer to the fat-cat tax loophole: Put off incorporation, setting up a board, and filing for 501(c)(3) determination.  Use an existing nonprofit as a kind of umbrella or shell to take in grants, handle donations, set up the bank account, and handle the paperwork for the banks, the IRS, the state, &c.  After all, the legal side of things is just a long list of boxes to check.  Do it once and centralize it.

That's fantasy.

Not making shares increase in value---nonprofit---has never been the same as not paying taxes on operations and donations---"tax exempt", of which "501(c)(3)" is one variety.  Getting the IRS to agree that a legal entity's purpose is tax-exempt is not the same as protecting contributors' personal assets from liability.
