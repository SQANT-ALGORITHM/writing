I was born and raised in the State of Texas.  Texas loves guns, and
on some days I crave a few rounds down range like I crave a Lucky
Strike or a pint of Blue Bell.

Not that I have any conscious, thinking desire to make guns---or
cigarettes---any part of my life again.  The urges are just tendrils
off the smoldering heaps of past dependencies, psychosomatic
aftershocks of reasoned and rigorous cold-turkey commitments.

Guns and their over-the-counter-strength analogs---knives and
"tactical" sundry of every description---are powerful drugs of
mostly false empowerment.  Aspects of their reality---technical,
visceral---and symbolism---littered across our popular culture---afford
them a talismanic quality, antidotal to the simmering dissociative
panic of complex modern life.

Anyone, no matter their political leaning, no matter their particular,
perhaps intensely personal view on firearms policy, can get high
off a gun, especially a concealed gun, especially the first time
they feel they're in control of it.  Guns' simultaneously palliative
and energizing effects are as human as the soothing warmth of public
recognition or the giddy haze of a Cannabis high.  As is the feeling
of withdrawal---"nakedness"---when the familiar gun is gone.

Tightly fitted to the receptors of the imagination, the gun's
"equalizing" power expands to fill all available mental space.
As big as your imagination can grow your fears---of random crime,
government run amok, or the TV bugbear of the week---it can grow
the gun.  When faith and clear answers come back in short supply,
the gun fells like a simple answer.  Storied institutions---economic,
political, and cultural---wait to share, defend, and monetize that
warm feeling of preparedness with you and all your kin.

Imagination thrives by its fertility, not its realism.  There is room
for a great deal of skill in the operation of firearms, but even
great skill and total familiarity do not guarantee disenthrallment
with the gun as prime prop in a perpetual play of security theater.
Rare is the fellow who can see the gun in wholly practical terms,
merely as it is, for exactly what it's worth.  So rare is the
fellow who really "drives the gun" sober.  And even the sober view
is not flattering, especially for those in fear of government, whose
mounting arsenals of militarized police, killer drones, surveillance,
and many-billion-dollar war machines are not measurable by caliber.
There is no magazine big enough to make that battle a fair one.

All that rationalizing be damned, it still took me longer than it
should have to realize that I am not one of the sober-minded few.
The gun always took me out of the realm of the wholly rational,
a nut in more ways than one.  It was always symbolic, mythical,
too much like a sword and not enough like a  wrench or a hammer.
Its effect on my gait and bearing was always greater than warranted,
rendering me more Walter Mitty than I ever want to be.

More than that, it numbed me into a kind of dull secessionism at odds
with all my better conscience.  I don't mean "secession" in the vein
of the wholly implausible Texas cry some honest yokel is called upon
to perform, a worn ritual of identity politics, whenever the summer
news cycle gets slow.  Rather, by masking the symptoms of anxieties
grounded at least partially in real and improvable social ills---crime,
retribution, and so on---the false feelings engendered by the power
fantasies of the gun sap my verve to engage with the complex realities
of the realm problems that might be improved.  Every investment
in violence---equipment, training, practice, and "preparedness"
writ large---serves instead as a vote of no confidence in the common
community project to which I might otherwise contribute.  At best, it's
an abdication of whatever responsibility follows what I know of law
and history.  At worst, my contribution to a very grim self-fulfilling
political prophecy.  One step closer to a bunker-dwelling paranoid
awaiting the kind of political outcome such abdication portends.

I have had thankfully few encounters with aggression very clearly
beyond deescalation.  It exists.  But given what we know of
history and our inherent biases, I like the margin of error on
nonviolence---withholding force when it's necessary---more than the
margin of error on the "Sheepdog" mentality---training a trigger
finger to start itching while peace still has a chance.  And I rate
the changes of meaningful contribution under the related mentality
far better.  Since the gun brings with it the secessionist mentality
in my own case, no guns for me.

My friends in California tend to scoff at all these palpitations.
