You can find my name on the door of my office building.  It doesn't
say "attorney at law" or "lawyer".  It says "deal mechanic".  I made
that choice.  And it had little to do with what you might think.
It had a lot to do with what I would see every day.

<!--jump-->

If there's one person who keeps me going these days, keeps me sucking
it up and doing the business, meeting standards that often make little
or no sense in the moment, it's my office building's UPS guy.

Lithe as a panther.  Maybe 40 or so.  Professional and courteous, every
time.  Effortlessly personable and polite, every time.  Never hands
off a package in silence.  Runs up two flights of stairs in an old
building to bring me books and less defensible bullshit from Amazon.
I think about him when I place an order.  Works a hell of a lot harder
than I do, that's for damn sure.  A black man in Oakland, working a
job that shouldn't be dangerous, hopefully isn't, but quite possibly
is, with a smile on his face, at least every time I see him.

When I was at The Big Law Firm, it was the office assistant.
The firm had a policy---formal or informal, I don't know---of hiring
folks with developmental or other mental differences, like milder
autism, to help out in their offices.  Good policy.  And this guy
was gold.  Not perfect---nobody is---but I'll be damned if the paper
in the printer outside my office ever ran low during business hours.
I'll be damned if anyone could walk the "break room" after an event
with food and tell that food had been there.  I'll be damned if he ever
complained in my presence.  I'm sure he had plenty to complain about.
Regardless, his responsibilities were clear, and to the extent they
were clear, their prompt performance was a given.

For several admittedly provincial definitions of "elite", I am elite.
I went to college.  I got the honors program degree.  I studied abroad.
Started a couple of graduate programs; finished one.  Learned a
language or two ... for fun.  Got into the fancy-pantsiest law school
in town, though the town wasn't much for fancy pants.

I milked those advantages for quite a lot.  I got the Big Law gig right
out of school.  I had the chance to take those pennants all the way
to the big social bank downtown, to hold myself out and work my way
up under them.  To look back for once and be proud of what I'd done,
which looked a lot like what folks are supposed to do.  But a reflex
kicked in.  I didn't see it coming.  I pulled for the ejector seat.

I wouldn't change my choice, but not because I think it's ideal.
That I should proceed on one path so long, then make a sudden break
... it's some kind of defect at work.  Maybe that's the point where I
screwed up.  Maybe I finally choked.  Maybe that was my family's chance
to really take off, earn in, graduate to a grander playing field.
My grandfathers were soldiers, so my father could be a merchant,
so I could be something patrician and heritable.  But then I got
romantic about folks who qualify for overtime.

I don't pretend that the UPS guy or the office assistant does the same
job I do.  I can't pretend that my responsibilities are well-defined,
that my days are predictable, that success and failure in my work are
discreet or even reliably discernible.  I won't pretend that doing
everything work-related myself, by choice, is perfectly efficient.
Perhaps the ideal lawyer only threatens to exist as a partner of some
kind of law firm.

But I do understand the trap in letting myself believe that standards
of hard, honest work are different from, rather than an important part
of, the standards for practicing law.  That everybody's role, whether
it's marketed as piece labor or "bespoke brains work" involves a fair
bit of day-to-day that can and should be performed to a workmanlike
standard.  Creativity and improvisation don't excuse sloppy rudiments.
I was developed for the brains work.  But I've a lot to learn yet on
those rudiments and how to perform them well.  I have a lot to learn
yet about how to enjoy performing them.

So "deal mechanic" it is.  Because more of what I aspire to now,
and more of what inspires me, presents alive and well in the trades,
in working folks, and among those whose roles don't come presoaked in
heady fumes of Achievement and Social Station.  Because, in the end,
my duty as participant in a monopoly on essential services requires
me to lop off as many aspects of my practice as are amenable to the
hardworking, tradesmanlike standards we all understand and appreciate,
and to make them workable that way.

If that project succeeds---and if it does, mine will have been a very
small part of the solution---perhaps I'll do my last deal in a country
where folks who punch the clock can afford their rights.  Where what's
left for lawyers to do is efficient, beautiful work people, and not
just externally financed hierarchies of them, can afford.
