I recently took up residence in a temporary office in San Francisco, pending a more permanent arrangement. Though I'm not comfortable leaving confidential client files or a computer at the location, I was happy enough to move some of the law books out of my apartment, to have on hand.

Here are the books that were worth keeping on hand, in no particular order:

## The American Institute of Architects Official Guide to the 2007 AIA Contract Documents

Construction contracts aren't yet a practice focus, but they are a constant inspiration. This book is the official guide to the first and oldest set of standard industry documents. While a little repetitive, rehashing commentary for common elements of each form agreement as it's covered, it's a decent introduction to the structure the documents create. It's also perhaps the best-typeset law book I've read.

## American Bar Association Model Stock Purchase Agreement with Commentary, Second Edition

There are a number of places to find form M&A agreements, but the ABA's has some of the deepest commentary, and some of the provisions stand up pretty well.

## Stark's Negotiating and Drafting Contract Boilerplate

Miraculously worth its sky-high price. Detailed coverage of routine "miscellaneous" section fodder, with supporting citations in all the right places. I don't imagine many practitioners will like the more informal, plain-talk style of the model provisions, but they are still excellent short guides to the subject matter coverage those kinds of provisions should have.

## American Law Institute Principles of the Law of Software Contracts

I share the disappointment of many commentators in the substance of the Principles. The Reporter's Notes, however, are very good to have on hand, especially for points of law related to contract formation.

## Maynard and Warren's Business Planning: Financing the Start-Up Business and Venture Capital Financing

One of two "casebooks", complete with red Aspen binding, that I still keep around. (And the only one I actually purchased during law school.) Hiding between the covers is an unusually practical guide to the "Valley Law" genre, written as a kind of job manual for young attorneys in the field. Though a good introduction, I don't refer to it for definitive answers very often, but sometimes find that I remember where in the book a certain edge case is treated, and can start there on the hunt for primary sources.

## Solove and Scwartz' Information Privacy Law, Fourth Edition

The other casebook on the shelf. Though my initial education in privacy law came about otherwise, I find the casebook well organized, and very often refer to it for the names of cases that relate to privacy law in a broader way, or cover more abstract points related to a specific statute.

## Classen's A Practical Guide to Software Licensing for Licensees and Licensors, Fifth Edition

The best available short-form book on software licensing, complete with a broad-ranging forms disk of remarkable quality. Buy it.

## Wight, Cooke, and Gray's The LSTA's Complete Credit Agreement Guide

Another truly excellent book, which I somehow found time to read cover-to-cover during my first months as a Big Law associate.

## Reed, LaJoux, and Nesvold's The Art of M&A: A Merger Acquisition Buyout Guide

## Williams and Chuvakin's PCI Compliance: Understanding and Implementing Effective PCI Data Security Standard Compliance, Fourth Edition

The best book I've been able to find on recent PCI compliance.

## Landy's The IT/Digital Legal Companion

A monstrous paperback written primarily for businesspeople, but which no lawyer should be ashamed to have on their bookshelf. The forms in appendices are of variable quality, but are often useful to skim as a kind of checklist for basic issues to cover in a more robust agreement. The front half provide great, nicely self-contained to the various kinds of agreements in broader industry context. I found its overview of commercial resale arrangement particularly clear early on.

## Garner's A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage

More practical and focused than the dictionary your relations bought you for law school. Is it "warranty" or "warrantee"? Is it "indemnification" or "indemnity"? Garner knows.

## Rosen's Open Source Licensing: Software Freedom and Intellectual Property Law

An excellent and truly approachable guide to open-source licensing. I often crib metaphors and explanations for clients. Also a great client loaner.

## St. Laurent's Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing

On hand for its running commentary on many common open-source licenses, when the text of the license itself isn't enough to find an answer quickly.

## Lajoux and Nesvold's The Art of M&A Structuring

A shorter, more focused, and more technical guide from the authors of the M&A Handbook.

## Mellinkoff's The Language of the Law

Perhaps my most-beloved law book. The word and phrase index of this book is an antidote to so much that's disappointing in contract drafting.

## Guth's Contract Negotiation Handbook: Software as a Service

A guide to SaaS contracts to buyer-biased you may need shots. Includes in-depth commentary on each provision of the author's form. Invaluable when representing a SaaS buyer, so long as you pick and choose how many and which of the extreme positions it advances you take. Be warned: Indiscriminate use of the book's form as it's written form would cause more than a few not-so-enterprise-grade Silicon Valley sellers to walk. The form is available in Word format from the author's website.

## Butterick's Typography for Lawyers

## Overly and Kalyvas' Software Agreement Line by Line

## Adams' A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting, Third Edition

## The Chicago Manual of Style, Sixteenth Edition
